## Greater KC study area
The study area is the Mid-America Regional Council (MARC) KC Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) as defined most recently in 2013, the 14 counties in Kansas and Missouri: Cass (MO), Clay (MO), Clinton (MO), Jackson (MO), Johnson (KS), Lafayette (MO), Leavenworth (KS), Miami (KS), Platte (MO), Ray (MO) and Wyandotte (KS). The Missouri-Kansas Combined Statistical Area (CSA) is possibly a better choice as it includes Douglas County (KS), where CANow does frequent work.
